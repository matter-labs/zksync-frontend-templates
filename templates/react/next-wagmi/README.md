This is a [zkSync](https://zksync.io) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`zksync-cli`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-cli)

# Getting Started

## Requirements
- A wallet extension like MetaMask installed in your browser.
- Node.js and npm installed.
- To use the `dockerized local node` or `in memory local node` setups, you will need to run the respective services in Docker. For detailed instructions on setting up and running these nodes, refer to the [Documentation](https://docs.zksync.io/build/test-and-debug).

## Installation
Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/pages/index.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.
